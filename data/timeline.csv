1997,转向开放Opening Up(1997-2001),去罪化Decriminalization,"中国LGBTQ+权利的第一个重大转折点出现在1997年，当时修订后的刑法取消了流氓罪和鸡奸罪，事实上使同性关系去罪化。The first major turning point for LGBTQ+ rights in China came in 1997 when the revised Criminal Law removed 'hooliganism' and 'sodomy' charges, effectively decriminalizing same-sex relations.",

2001,转向开放Opening Up(1997-2001),去病化Depathologization,"2001年，中国精神病学协会进一步将同性恋从其精神疾病名单中移除，这标志着去病理化的关键一步。In 2001, the Chinese Psychiatric Association further removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, marking a crucial step toward depathologization.",
2002,日益包容与认可Emerging Tolerance and Semi-Recognition(2001-2015),In the years following depathologization, China witnessed growing, albeit unofficial, LGBTQ+ visibility. Queer individuals and communities found space in entertainment, literature, and online discourse. This period saw increased discussion of LGBTQ+ issues, with activists pushing for legal and social recognition. However, the state adopted a passive stance—while it did not openly suppress queer communities, it also provided no legal protections or explicit support. LGBTQ+ existence was tolerated but remained outside the realm of formal recognition.,

2015,加强控制和审查Tightening Control and Censorship (2015–2020),,Around 2015, state attitudes shifted as authorities began exerting tighter control over public expressions of queer identity. Media regulations increasingly restricted LGBTQ+ representation, with television and streaming platforms banning “abnormal sexual relationships.” Public events, such as LGBTQ+ rights conferences and Pride gatherings, faced growing scrutiny and cancellation. Online censorship intensified, and advocacy organizations encountered legal and bureaucratic obstacles. This period signaled a regression from passive tolerance to active suppression, as the government sought to limit LGBTQ+ visibility in the public sphere.,

2020,模糊的边界与暧昧的政策Elusive Boundaries and Ambiguous Policies (2020–Present),In recent years, China’s stance on LGBTQ+ issues has become increasingly ambiguous, marked by unpredictable enforcement and shifting red lines. While LGBTQ+ topics are not outright criminalized, they exist in a precarious gray zone where visibility is constantly negotiated. Some queer narratives manage to circulate through coded language, private online spaces, and commercial entertainment, but official recognition remains distant. Authorities employ selective enforcement, allowing certain expressions while swiftly cracking down on activism and political advocacy. The result is a landscape where LGBTQ+ individuals must navigate an ever-changing set of boundaries, never fully certain where they stand in the eyes of the state.,,
